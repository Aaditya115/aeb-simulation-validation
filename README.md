# Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) – Simulation & Validation

This project implements a simplified Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system
using time-to-collision (TTC) logic and simulation-based validation.

The goal is to model safety-critical decision logic and evaluate system behavior
across normal, edge, and failure scenarios using a virtual maturation approach.

## System Overview
- Simulated ego vehicle approaching obstacles
- TTC-based Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and AEB triggering
- Scenario-based testing under varying sensor confidence
- Validation metrics for safety performance

## Key Concepts
- Time-to-Collision (TTC)
- Safety-first decision logic
- False positive vs missed braking tradeoffs
- Simulation-based validation
